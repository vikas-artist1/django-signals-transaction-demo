### By default, do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

**Answer:** Yes, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller by default. This means that when a signal is triggered, the operations performed within the signal handler are part of the same transaction as the operation initiated by the caller. Django signals are executed within the same atomic block as the caller's database operation. An atomic block ensures that all tasks within it are treated as a single unit of work, and that they all succeed or all fail together.

Below is the code snippet that demonstrates signals run in the same database transaction as the caller:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import transaction

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received for:", instance.name)
    # Modifying the instance within the signal handler
    instance.name = "Modified"
    instance.save()  # Save the modified instance within the same transaction

# Creating an instance of MyModel
obj = MyModel.objects.create(name="Original")

# Printing the name of the object before and after saving
print("Name before save:", obj.name)

# Starting a new transaction explicitly
with transaction.atomic():
    # Updating the object within the transaction
    obj.name = "Updated"
    obj.save()  # Save the modified object

# Printing the name of the object after saving
print("Name after save:", obj.name)
